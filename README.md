## ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges Faced

During the development of the Smart Task Manager, I encountered a few key challenges:

- **Gemini API Integration & Rate Limits:**  
  Google Gemini API sometimes enforces strict quota limits causing AI subtask suggestions to fail. I implemented robust error handling on both backend and frontend to handle these gracefully, showing user-friendly messages when AI suggestions are temporarily unavailable.

- **Environment Variable Management:**  
  Securely storing and accessing the Gemini API key through environment variables for safe deployment.

This project enhanced my skills in asynchronous API handling, error recovery, and secure environment configuration.
